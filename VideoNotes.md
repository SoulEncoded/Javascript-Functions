How's it going guys, welcome to another Soul Encoded Tutorial.

Today we are going to go over Closures and Recursion in Javascript.
Let's do this!

[INTRO]

Last tutorial we left off talking about the various aspects of functions. I hope you guys
were able to complete the challenges and are ready to learn about Closures and Recursion. 

Now remember that Closures and Recursions are one of the most commonly miss understood topics

But don't worry we will break it down and hopefully it will be very straight forward after this tutorial.

Alright lets dive into Closures.

Kyle Simpson is the author of `You Don't Know Js` it's one of the most popular javascript books out there. 
I feel that his definition is the best in regards to Closure

He states that "Closure is when a function is able to remember and access its 
lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope."

Now what's lexical scope? 

Lexical scope is just referring to the scope where the variables and blocks of scope have been authored in the source code.

Basically if you create a function it creates a local scope. all the variables and methods inside of the local scope is considered to be its lexical scope
